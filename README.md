## **Project Descriptions & How to Run**

### **1. Smart Traffic Light System**

**Path:** `Project_1_Traffic_Light/traffic_light.ino`
A simplified embedded traffic system running on Arduino logic.

**Features:**

* Non-blocking timing using `millis()`
* Dynamic green time based on queue length
* Simple hardware: 3 LEDs + 1 button
* Debug output via Serial
* 100% compatible with Tinkercad Circuits

**Run:**
Import `.ino` into Arduino IDE or Tinkercad.

---

### **2. Advanced System Monitoring Script**

**Path:** `Project_2_System_Monitor/monitor.sh`

A Bash-based system utility for monitoring CPU, RAM, and disk usage.

**Highlights:**

* No root access required
* Logs saved under `~/sysmonitor.log`
* Threshold-based alerts
* Menu-driven interface
* Background monitoring mode

**Run:**

```
chmod +x monitor.sh
./monitor.sh
```

---

### **3. Student Management System**

**Path:** `Project_3_Student_Management/student_management.c`

A C program for managing student records with analytics and persistent storage.

**Features:**

* Create, read, update, delete student entries
* Data stored in efficient binary format
* Sorting by GPA, name, or ID using `qsort`
* Reporting: averages, top students, distributions
* Input validation + robust error handling

**Compile & Run:**

```
gcc student_management.c -o student
./student
```

---

### **4. Dynamic Math & Data Processing Engine**

**Path:** `Project_4_Math_Engine/math_engine.c`

A modular and extensible computational engine.

**Key Features:**

* Function pointers for dynamic operation selection
* Dynamic memory allocation for datasets
* File-based dataset loading and saving
* Searching, sorting, statistical operations
* Clean and intuitive terminal UI

**Compile & Run:**

```
gcc math_engine.c -o mathengine
./mathengine
```

---

### **5. Multi-threaded Web Scraper**

**Path:** `Project_5_Web_Scraper/scraper.c`

A POSIX-threads web scraping simulator.

**Features:**

* Parallel page fetching
* Thread-isolated file outputs
* Simulated URLs (no dependencies)
* Graceful failure detection for bad URLs
* Clean thread lifecycle (create → join → exit)

**Compile & Run:**

```
gcc scraper.c -o scraper -lpthread
./scraper
```

---

## **Technologies Demonstrated**

* Low-level C programming
* Pointers, structs, and dynamic memory management
* File I/O (binary and text)
* Algorithm design: sorting, searching, reporting
* Bash scripting and Linux utilities
* Multi-threading with POSIX pthreads
* Modular design and code documentation
